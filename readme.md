# Warehouse

Warehouse has been my (Eve Aviv Keinan's) first in-depth programming project, an inventory management interface inspired by the inventory systems in (usually) "sandbox" video-games.\
A comprehensive history/retrospective of the project is available in the same page (i.e HTML) as the project itself.

**This project is discontinued and is thus not accepting any contributions.**
